==================
Changelog
==================

Versions follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ (``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``),
but with minor syntax differences to satisfy python package
`version specifiers <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/>`_.

Until a stable version is released (end of beta), new versions may contain backward-incompatible changes,
but we will strive to deprecate features first instead of immediately removal.
After that, breaking changes will only be introduced in major versions.

.. custom-non-guaranteed-behavior::

  Some aspects of behavior are not guaranteed and could be changed at any release without any mention in the changelog
  (or even vary in different environments or different runs).

  Such details are highlighted in the documentation via this admonition.
